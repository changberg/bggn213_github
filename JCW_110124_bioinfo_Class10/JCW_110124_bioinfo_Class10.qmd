What is in the PDB database anyway? Summary data grabbed from: https://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("PDB_stats_summaryfile.csv", row.names = 1)
pdbstats
```

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$Total
x
```

```{r}
#as.numeric(x): Warning: NAs introduced by coercion[1]  NA  NA  NA  NA 213  22
```

```{r}
gsub(',', '', x)
```

doesn't like the commas, ask google. can also use "claude" use gsub to replace commas with nothings

```{r}
convertednocomma <- function(x){
  #remove comma
  x <- gsub(',', '', x)
  #convert to numeric
  x <- as.numeric(x)
  return(x)
}
```

```{r}
convertednocomma(pdbstats$Total)
```

```{r}
n.tot <- sum(convertednocomma(pdbstats$Total))
n.tot
```

The `apply()` function is very useful as it can take any function and "Apply" it over either the ROWS or COLs of a data.frame.

```{r}
colSums(apply(pdbstats, 2, convertednocomma))/n.tot


```

```{r}
#another way of importing data to avoid issues with commas in the numbas
#library(readr)
#read_csv("PDB_stats_summaryfile.csv")
```

Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
n.xray <- sum(convertednocomma(pdbstats$X.ray))
n.em <- sum(convertednocomma(pdbstats$EM))

xraypercent <- ((n.xray/n.tot)*100)
empercent <- ((n.em/n.tot)*100)

xraypercent
empercent
```

> 83.26% (xray%), 10.23% (EM%)

Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
n.totalprots <- 195866/n.tot

n.totalprots
```

> 86.4%

Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

> 4,640

## Using Mol\*

![My first image from Mol-star :D](1HSG.png)

Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

> Cannot see Hydrogen at this resolution, the only atom being displayed here is oxygen.

Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

> This water molecule's residue number is HOH 308

Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## Use the Bio3D package for structural Bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

Q7. How many amino acids are there in this structure?

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

> There are 198 amino acids in this structure

Q8. Name one of the two non-protein residues?

> HOH (water)

Q9. How many protein chains are in this structure?

> 2

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
library(r3dmol)
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")

library(shiny)
view.pdb(pdb)
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)

mktrj(modes, pdb=adk, file='adk.pdb') #give it the pdb= thing to have proper seq
```

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN?

> biocmanager

Q.11 Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?

> bio3d

Q.12 True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?

> True

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

> There are 214 AAs

##Blast or hmmer search

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

##Plot a summary of search results:

```{r}
hits <- plot(b)
```

##List some "Top Hits" and download their .pdb files:

```{r}
head(hits$pdb.id)
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

##Align and Superimpose structures:

```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)
#plot(pdbs, labels=ids)

#commenting out, as R will not render this figure. It is added here as a screenshot.
```

![pdbs plot](plot.png)

##Annotate PDB Structures

```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)
```

```{r}
anno
```

##Perform PCA

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

##Calculate RMSD and show structure-based clustering

```{r}
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)


hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```
